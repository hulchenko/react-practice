Babel used to transpile from JSX to JS
ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root')) placed inside JSX
JS always in { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }
JSX must return a single element
ex: const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;

<!-- {/* */} << this only --> for comments

ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode) to render React elements to DOM
camelCase for everything.
class = className
<br> = <br />

<hr> = <hr />
